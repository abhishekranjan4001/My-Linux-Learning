# My Linux Learning Journey

## Introduction
Linux is a powerful, open-source operating system widely used in servers, development environments, and personal computing. Learning Linux equips individuals with essential skills in system administration, security, automation, and DevOps. This document serves as a structured guide to understanding Linux fundamentals, practical commands, and advanced concepts.

Linux operates through a command-line interface (CLI), allowing users to interact with the system efficiently. Mastering Linux involves understanding its file system, user management, networking, scripting, and automation capabilities. The following sections break down these topics systematically to facilitate learning.

## 1. Basic Linux Commands
### File and Directory Management
- `ls` - List files and directories
- `cd` - Change directory
- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `cp` - Copy files and directories
- `mv` - Move/rename files and directories
- `rm` - Remove files and directories
- `mkdir` - Create directories
- `rmdir` - Remove empty directories

### File Viewing
- `cat` - View file content
- `less` / `more` - Paginate file content
- `head` - View the first 10 lines of a file
- `tail` - View the last 10 lines of a file

### File Permissions & Ownership
- `chmod` - Change file permissions
- `chown` - Change file owner
- `chgrp` - Change group ownership

### Process Management
- `ps` - Display active processes
- `top` / `htop` - Monitor processes in real-time
- `kill` / `killall` - Terminate processes

### Disk Usage & Storage
- `df` - Display disk space usage
- `du` - Display directory size
- `mount` / `umount` - Mount and unmount file systems
- `lsblk` - List information about storage devices

### Networking
- `ping` - Test network connectivity
- `netstat` / `ss` - Display network connections
- `ifconfig` / `ip` - Show network interfaces
- `nslookup` - Query DNS records
- `curl` / `wget` - Fetch data from URLs

---

## 2. User & Group Management
- `useradd`, `passwd`, `usermod`, `userdel` - Manage users
- `groupadd`, `groupmod`, `groupdel`, `groups` - Manage groups
- `su`, `sudo` - Switch users and execute commands as root
- `chmod`, `chown`, `umask`, `ACLs (setfacl, getfacl)` - Manage file permissions

---

## 3. Shell Scripting
- Variables and User Input
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `until`)
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `case`)
- Functions in Shell Scripts
- Automating Tasks (Cron Jobs, `at`, `systemd` timers)
- Handling Signals (`trap` command)

---
## 4. Package Management
### Debian-based (Ubuntu, Debian)
- `apt-get`, `apt`, `dpkg`
### RHEL-based (CentOS, Fedora)
- `yum`, `dnf`, `rpm`
### Universal Package Managers
- `snap`, `flatpak`, `AppImage`
- Compiling from Source (`make`, `cmake`, `configure`)

---

## 5. System Administration
- Managing Services: `systemctl`, `service`
- Job Scheduling: `cron`, `crontab`, `at`
- Log Management: `journalctl`, `/var/log/`
- Kernel & Boot Process: `dmesg`, `grub`, `init`
- Performance Monitoring: `top`, `htop`, `iotop`, `vmstat`, `sar`

---

## 6. File Systems & Disk Management
- Partitioning: `fdisk`, `parted`, `lsblk`
- File System Operations: `mkfs`, `fsck`, `tune2fs`
- Mounting & Unmounting: `mount`, `umount`, `/etc/fstab`
- Disk Usage Analysis: `df`, `du`, `ncdu`
- RAID & LVM Basics: `mdadm`, `lvcreate`, `lvextend`, `vgcreate`

---

## 7. Networking & Security
- Configuring Network: `ip a`, `ifconfig`, `nmcli`, `iwconfig`
- Firewall Management: `iptables`, `ufw`, `firewalld`
- SSH & Remote Access: `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync`
- VPN & Tunneling: `openvpn`, `ssh -L`, `ssh -R`
- User Security: `passwd`, `chage`, `fail2ban`
- Encrypting Data: `gpg`, `openssl`

---

## 8. Linux Kernel & OS Concepts
- Understanding the Kernel (`uname -r`, `modprobe`, `lsmod`)
- Process Management (`ps`, `top`, `nice`)
- Memory Management (`free -m`, `vmstat`)
- I/O Management (`iostat`, `iotop`)
- Signals (`kill`, `trap`)

---

## 9. DevOps & Automation
